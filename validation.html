    <p> During this term, under lizes supervision i have learnt a wide variety of different compolsary skills needed to become a professional programmer especially in the field of web development.
One of the key attributes that i picked up from Liz was how she emphasised the importance of staying up to date with all the newer looking sites that had already been established and popular.
I realised how that thinking out your head would only to either exeggearated thoughts that couldnt be actioned or simple thinking that could result in your work being below par and not even close to a professional standard.
</p><p>Liz's solution made it easy so that you could apply your unique knowledge to the standards of professional and popular sites that have already been published. One of the major imoplementations that Liz mentioned was how the importance of responsive structure of sites were a real factor.
She explained that by making your website seem more alive that you would make it seem more natural to users that engaged to the site. It would make it more consistent with all the different types of devizes that had been already created.
During our 5-8 topics of our term we learned how the implements of CSS should really be taken into account, and the reason for this was that it really helped when creating your site that you was fully proficient in CSS and that you was comftable enough to add the more complex codes necessary to liven up your site.

    <p class="sample-text">During the beginning of our term Liz went through the introductory phase of web development and really explained the key foundations that were required to make a website. For example Liz explained that making sure to establish all the key elements required i.e the header, body and footer to be implemented correctly, with them lines of code correctly put in it could set a clear and easy foundation for the developer to add on, even when codes reach a complex level.
    Another key yet overlooked tag was the commenting which once again Liz really emphasised on.</p><p> The reason for this was that just like the skeleton code, commenting really helped to keep track of where certain code was and when your lines of code become extremely complex, and commenting wasn't something that was restricted to HTML.
    Another key yet rarely explained codes were that media queries that would essentially help the responsiveness of the site. Now a lot of reason as to why media queries is that they don't usually get the factor that the code has on the site. However by making your site more responsive, it provides a wide variety of benefits that allow you site to be viewed in different user forms such as phones,tablets etc.</p>

      <p>methods of good practice:

The definition of MGP is the guideline design layout that's required to provide the best & up to date website possible. Now in addition to sustainind up to date designs but also the intent in which you want you website to be fundementally based upon.
For example if you required your website to be founded upon usability (i.e navigation), with the MGP guideline you could attain all the necessary requirement to help you provide the best possible website while achieving all of the necessary content and information you wish to add.
Also the main factor of MGP is it provides you with the guidlines to attain minimilism, like for example by providing 3-6 options instead of 10-15 it allows you to make it easier for users to fully navigate.</p>
<p>
There are so many different current website that have mastered the art of showing up to date website that provide revolutionary content layout making it easier for users to access certain and specific information with ease. All the major companies like (Apple, Samsung, Nike, Sony) have all mastered this art.The usage of banners have also become a huge element in the web design world; why?</p> <p>Well as we all know images can tell a thousand words, and with that in mind newer sites have become more image eccentric , by attaching more meaningful images to the website in ways that provides information but on a more vibrant and easy way, providing users with not a lot of reading to do, if they want to find something out.

In conclusion, with the information that i have provided i have followed the MGP as much as possible to try and attain an easy and simple website for users to navigate through .</p>

      <!-- section below is the apple section with image and text -->
      <img class="sample" src="images/screenshot3.jpg" alt="apple-screenshot">
      <p class="sample-text">During our CSY1018 (web development), liz mentioned how important it was not to work out of your head and try to recreate a site that had been influenced by popular HTML5 sites. From the image to your right you can see that in our web group we decided that the <a class="link" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/">'apple'</a> was a great example, reasons being that for one it was a extremly popular site that required to be leading in terms of UI design. Also from the image, you can also see how the size of the banner is a key factor, when promoting certain elements.</p><p> Now we realized that all the newer sites all attained exceedingly large banners either in static or carousel form, to capture the attension of users. Another addition that we notices was that the navbar was kept with minimal options allowing once again users to feel at ease knowing that their isnt too much information thay requires to be attained. In conclusion, we realized that these were the elements that had caught our attention.

    <div class="seven">
      <!-- section below is the 24seven section with image and text -->
      <img class="sample2" src="images/screenshot.jpg" alt="24seven-screenshot">
      <p class="sample-text2">With Liz emphasising on how important it was not to work out of your head, as a web group we continued to find other suitable samples that would thought fit the required elements, and with several mentions put forward we eventually decided that the website that i had build for <a class="link" href="http://www.24sevencars.co.uk/">'24seven'</a> met quite a lot of the requirement.As you can see from the image to your left it shows how the layout of the site is extremely simple, yet provides all the necessary content for users to feel that they have gained some insight however have not been flooded with too much information.</p><p> Also in addition, logo and the menu-bar are both in the same container making it easier to recognise the companies site and also navigate at same time. Now when it came to improving our influences into a layout that we thought was perfect, we ended noting all the compulsory components that we felt that was needed and understood that from our influences we realised that they prioritised simplicity which is what we ended going for.

    <p>From an early age I've always been deeply interested in computing. A world surrounded by modern technology, computing has had a  big impact on society. It has enabled most citizens who have access to communicate effectively, expressing their ideas and utilizing their creativity to the best of their ability. I have always been intrigued by the concept of learning about computing. My interest was sparked when my uncle introduced me to the computer systems online as a freelancer. With a gradual understanding of computing i decided to take a apprenticeship in Information communication technology.
Whilst undertaking an apprenticeship In ICT; I studied a wide range of computing aspects ranging from  HTML5,CSS3 & Java Script, general Web Design and Programming. Whilst learning the IT course I had gained a good insight into computing which improved my confidence in planning, writing, programming, design and communication skills related to computing. I gained great experience and a good sense in what path i wanted to head in my future career. The course had enabled me to improve my communications skills whilst working in groups discussing the assignment that was given and finishing projects with the other students by using effective communication skills to decide each role in the project. Learning to meet deadlines improved my planning skills which in addition; helped me to  set out goals and smart targets to simplify my future plans.
I also studied business and marketing alongside my apprenticeship such as; introduction to marketing, business environment and digital marketing which has helped me to gain a wider understanding about computing in the business world; but to also help better understand Digital Marketing . Studying business alongside the ICT apprenticeship has given me the experience in the best of both.
During my later years at school I had been involved in work experience given the role of an online freelancer. I had learnt on the job how to design and specify unique websites for clients. This elevated my understanding of computing; specifically website design to a new level. I also took upon work experience as a office junior, where my main duties were the stereotypical duties of an office junior;  handling paperwork, answering telephones, handling complaints, dealing with customers ; once again this elevated my business and customer service experience</p>
<p>
In terms of speciality i think i have developed key skills such as having the ability to visualize certain elements for example taking written samples providing me with details on how to construct a website, and implement thag script into a extremely user friendly website whilst following the provided guidlines. I have also gained insight on the architectural insight of the layout and structure of modern websites. I have mastered the most efficient ways to place key component of a site (i.e text, images, video etc), with study of thousands of different popular HTML5 sites, i have attained insight on the most effective elements to place on a site, say for example the ‘F layout’ method.
